hello guys
This program that you see written in C++ language is related to a coffee shop that takes the menu and product prices from the price and inventory files and works based on them in the program.
This program has the ability to store customers' names and phone numbers, as well as store what customers order and announce the final price and also give the daily income of the coffee shop.
Also, by going to the warehouse alerts section, you can see which products are in short supply in the coffee shop and should be purchased.
Enjoy it!
